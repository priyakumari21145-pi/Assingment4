Project README
This project contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic file handling operations.
1. Task1.py
- Reads a file named `sample.txt`.
- Prints file contents line by line.
- Handles FileNotFoundError gracefully.
2. Task2.py
- Writes user input to `output.txt`.
- Appends additional text to the same file.
- Reads and displays the final content.
- Handles input/output errors using try-except blocks.
